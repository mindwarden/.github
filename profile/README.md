> We are providing free, fast, decentralized, and secure instant messaging service. We prioritize privacy and security in digital communication. By having no central server, we ensure data is stored only on users' computers, enhancing security. Decentralizing data storage eliminates single points of failure and reduces the risk of data breaches. This method not only secures user data but also gives individuals complete control over their messages. Our commitment to privacy means every message is protected by end-to-end encryption, safeguarding content from potential eavesdroppers. Ultimately, we aim to create a communication platform that respects user privacy, provides robust security, and operates seamlessly without relying on centralized infrastructure.

> Our primary and most significant goal is to actively fight for and advocate free speech in regions where it is severely suppressed by an oppressive and totalitarian government. We aim to provide this essential freedom of expression to people all around the world. Our mission is not just to promote free speech, but to ensure that we do so without ever compromising the user experience. We believe that everyone, regardless of their location or circumstances, deserves the right to express their thoughts and opinions freely, and we are dedicated to making this a reality.
